# Channel-Equalization
1.Develop a Equalizer Using Least Mean Square Algorithm

2.Plot Bit Error Rate (BER) vs Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) curve for 
BPSK, QPSK, and 64 QAM with and without equalization.

3.Study the variation of convergence time with the order of equalizer

4.Plot the frequency domain spectrum of the channel and compare it 
with the spectrum of the equalizer
